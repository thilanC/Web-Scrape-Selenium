Moderate hypertensive retinopathy was often referred to as \"accelerated hypertension,\" but this term should likewise be avoided. Patients with moderate to severe hypertensive retinopathy frequently have acute hypertensive nephrosclerosis (formerly called \"malignant nephrosclerosis\"), although kidney biopsies are seldom performed.</p><p></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Historically, papilledema was the hallmark of a more advanced condition (ie, \"malignant hypertension\") associated with a higher mortality (akin to having a malignancy). However, the advent of effective antihypertensive drug therapy has improved the prognosis and patients with severe hypertensive retinopathy have similar outcomes to those with moderate hypertensive retinopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderate-to-severe-hypertensive-retinopathy-and-hypertensive-encephalopathy-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

It is primarily a diagnosis of exclusion after other causes of central nervous system dysfunction are ruled out, and it characteristically responds dramatically to acute lowering of the mean arterial pressure, sometimes by as little as 10 to 15 percent. (See  <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-hypertensive-emergencies-in-adults?sectionName=Neurologic%20emergencies&amp;topicRef=3833&amp;anchor=H60092188&amp;source=see_link#H60092188\" class=\"medical medical_review\">\"Evaluation and treatment of hypertensive emergencies in adults\", section on 'Neurologic emergencies'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"xhash_H2\"><span class=\"h1 xhash_H2_scrollTarget\">MECHANISMS OF VASCULAR INJURY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&nbsp;—&nbsp;</span>With mild to moderate elevations in blood pressure (BP), the initial response is arterial and arteriolar vasoconstriction. This autoregulatory process both maintains tissue perfusion at a relatively constant level and prevents the increase in pressure from being transmitted to the smaller, more distal vessels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderate-to-severe-hypertensive-retinopathy-and-hypertensive-encephalopathy-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>With increasingly severe hypertension, however, autoregulation eventually fails  (<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/image?imageKey=NEPH%2F57676&amp;topicKey=NEPH%2F3833&amp;source=see_link\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57676 graphic-hover-tooltip-unique115\" aria-expanded=\"false\" data-gfx-modal-btn=\"\">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderate-to-severe-hypertensive-retinopathy-and-hypertensive-encephalopathy-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The ensuing rise in pressure in the arterioles and capillaries leads to acute damage to the vascular wall. Disruption of the vascular endothelium then allows plasma constituents (including fibrinoid material) to enter the vascular wall, thereby narrowing or obliterating the vascular lumen. Within the brain, the breakthrough vasodilation from failure of autoregulation leads to the development of cerebral edema and the clinical picture of hypertensive encephalopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderate-to-severe-hypertensive-retinopathy-and-hypertensive-encephalopathy-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>The level at which fibrinoid necrosis occurs depends upon the chronic baseline BP (prior to the substantial increase in BP). Patients with chronic hypertension have arteriolar hypertrophy that minimizes the transmission of pressure to the capillary circulation. Grades III and IV hypertensive retinopathy are often associated with diastolic pressures above 120 mmHg. By comparison, hypertensive encephalopathy can be seen at diastolic pressures as low as 100 mmHg in previously normotensive patients with acute hypertension due to preeclampsia or acute glomerulonephritis; patients in whom autoregulation is impaired also may develop hypertensive injury at relatively mild degrees of hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderate-to-severe-hypertensive-retinopathy-and-hypertensive-encephalopathy-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>In addition to protecting tissues against the effects of severe hypertension, autoregulation also maintains tissue perfusion during the treatment of hypertension via arterial and arteriolar vasodilation. Since flow is equal to pressure divided by resistance, parallel reductions in both parameters allow sufficient blood flow to be maintained. However, an excessive hypotensive response <strong>below</strong> the autoregulatory range can lead to ischemic symptoms  (<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/image?imageKey=NEPH%2F57676&amp;topicKey=NEPH%2F3833&amp;source=see_link\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57676 graphic-hover-tooltip-unique115\" aria-expanded=\"false\" data-gfx-modal-btn=\"\">figure 1</a>). The arteriolar hypertrophy induced by chronic hypertension means that hypoperfusion will occur at a higher BP than in normotensive subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderate-to-severe-hypertensive-retinopathy-and-hypertensive-encephalopathy-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>It has been suggested that factors other than the level of BP, particularly activation of the renin-angiotensin system, may contribute to the development of fibrinoid necrosis. Plasma renin activity is often increased in patients with grades III and IV hypertensive retinopathy, potentially mediated by both an initial natriuresis induced by the high pressure and renal vascular injury. The importance of the renin-angiotensin system in the vascular injury of severe hypertension has been demonstrated in transgenic rats [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderate-to-severe-hypertensive-retinopathy-and-hypertensive-encephalopathy-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In this study, rats prone to severe hypertension were treated with low-dose <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ramipril-drug-information?topicRef=3833&amp;source=see_link\" data-topicid=\"9851\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ramipril</a> (5 mg/day) or no therapy. Ramipril significantly reduced the frequency of arteriolar fibrinoid necrosis, despite having no significant effect on BP, suggesting a role for the renin-angiotensin system independent of BP.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"xhash_H3\"><span class=\"h1 xhash_H3_scrollTarget\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS AND DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&nbsp;—&nbsp;</span>Moderate to severe hypertensive retinopathy and hypertensive encephalopathy most often occur in patients with longstanding, uncontrolled hypertension, many of whom have discontinued antihypertensive drug therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderate-to-severe-hypertensive-retinopathy-and-hypertensive-encephalopathy-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

The ensuing rise in pressure in the arterioles and capillaries leads to acute damage to the vascular wall. Disruption of the vascular endothelium then allows plasma constituents (including fibrinoid material) to enter the vascular wall, thereby narrowing or obliterating the vascular lumen. Within the brain, the breakthrough vasodilation from failure of autoregulation leads to the development of cerebral edema and the clinical picture of hypertensive encephalopathy [<a class=\"abstract_t\" href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderate-to-severe-hypertensive-retinopathy-and-hypertensive-encephalopathy-in-adults/abstract/8\">8</a>].</p><p>The level at which fibrinoid necrosis occurs depends upon the chronic baseline BP (prior to the substantial increase in BP). Patients with chronic hypertension have arteriolar hypertrophy that minimizes the transmission of pressure to the capillary circulation. Grades III and IV hypertensive retinopathy are often associated with diastolic pressures above 120 mmHg. By comparison, hypertensive encephalopathy can be seen at diastolic pressures as low as 100 mmHg in previously normotensive patients with acute hypertension due to preeclampsia or acute glomerulonephritis; patients in whom autoregulation is impaired also may develop hypertensive injury at relatively mild degrees of hypertension [<a class=\"abstract_t\" href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderate-to-severe-hypertensive-retinopathy-and-hypertensive-encephalopathy-in-adults/abstract/8\">8</a>].</p><p>In addition to protecting tissues against the effects of severe hypertension, autoregulation also maintains tissue perfusion during the treatment of hypertension via arterial and arteriolar vasodilation.

This autoregulatory process both maintains tissue perfusion at a relatively constant level and prevents the increase in pressure from being transmitted to the smaller, more distal vessels [<a class=\"abstract_t\" href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderate-to-severe-hypertensive-retinopathy-and-hypertensive-encephalopathy-in-adults/abstract/8\">8</a>].</p>,\n",
       " <p>With increasingly severe hypertension, however, autoregulation eventually fails  (<a aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57676 graphic-hover-tooltip-unique115\" data-gfx-modal-btn=\"\" href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/image?imageKey=NEPH%2F57676&amp;topicKey=NEPH%2F3833&amp;source=see_link\">figure 1</a>) [<a class=\"abstract_t\" href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderate-to-severe-hypertensive-retinopathy-and-hypertensive-encephalopathy-in-adults/abstract/8\">8</a>]. The ensuing rise in pressure in the arterioles and capillaries leads to acute damage to the vascular wall. Disruption of the vascular endothelium then allows plasma constituents (including fibrinoid material) to enter the vascular wall, thereby narrowing or obliterating the vascular lumen. Within the brain, the breakthrough vasodilation from failure of autoregulation leads to the development of cerebral edema and the clinical picture of hypertensive encephalopathy [<a class=\"abstract_t\" href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderate-to-severe-hypertensive-retinopathy-and-hypertensive-encephalopathy-in-adults/abstract/8\">8</a>].</p>,\n",
       " <p>The level at which fibrinoid necrosis occurs depends upon the chronic baseline BP (prior to the substantial increase in BP). Patients with chronic hypertension have arteriolar hypertrophy that minimizes the transmission of pressure to the capillary circulation. Grades III and IV hypertensive retinopathy are often associated with diastolic pressures above 120 mmHg. By comparison, hypertensive encephalopathy can be seen at diastolic pressures as low as 100 mmHg in previously normotensive patients with acute hypertension due to preeclampsia or acute glomerulonephritis; patients in whom autoregulation is impaired also may develop hypertensive injury at relatively mild degrees of hypertension [<a class=\"abstract_t\" href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderate-to-severe-hypertensive-retinopathy-and-hypertensive-encephalopathy-in-adults/abstract/8\">8</a>].</p>,\n",
       " <p>In addition to protecting tissues against the effects of severe hypertension, autoregulation also maintains tissue perfusion during the treatment of hypertension via arterial and arteriolar vasodilation. Since flow is equal to pressure divided by resistance, parallel reductions in both parameters allow sufficient blood flow to be maintained. However, an excessive hypotensive response <strong>below</strong> the autoregulatory range can lead to ischemic symptoms  (<a aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57676 graphic-hover-tooltip-unique115\" data-gfx-modal-btn=\"\" href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/image?imageKey=NEPH%2F57676&amp;topicKey=NEPH%2F3833&amp;source=see_link\">figure 1</a>). The arteriolar hypertrophy induced by chronic hypertension means that hypoperfusion will occur at a higher BP than in normotensive subjects [<a class=\"abstract_t\" href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderate-to-severe-hypertensive-retinopathy-and-hypertensive-encephalopathy-in-adults/abstract/8\">8</a>].</p>,\n",
       " <p>It has been suggested that factors other than the level of BP, particularly activation of the renin-angiotensin system, may contribute to the development of fibrinoid necrosis. Plasma renin activity is often increased in patients with grades III and IV hypertensive retinopathy, potentially mediated by both an initial natriuresis induced by the high pressure and renal vascular injury. The importance of the renin-angiotensin system in the vascular injury of severe hypertension has been demonstrated in transgenic rats [<a class=\"abstract_t\" href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderate-to-severe-hypertensive-retinopathy-and-hypertensive-encephalopathy-in-adults/abstract/9\">9</a>].

       " 'Moderate to severe hypertensive retinopathy  Moderate to severe hypertensive retinopathy, corresponding to grades III and IV hypertensive retinopathy, is characterized by retinal hemorrhages, exudates, and papilledema  (image 1) [6].

       " '',\n",
       " 'Severe hypertensive retinopathy was formerly called \"malignant hypertension,\" a term that clinicians should avoid (although it is used for administrative purposes in the United States). Moderate hypertensive retinopathy was often referred to as \"accelerated hypertension,\" but this term should likewise be avoided. Patients with moderate to severe hypertensive retinopathy frequently have acute hypertensive nephrosclerosis (formerly called \"malignant nephrosclerosis\"), although kidney biopsies are seldom performed.',\n",
       " '',\n",
       " 'Historically, papilledema was the hallmark of a more advanced condition (ie, \"malignant hypertension\") associated with a higher mortality (akin to having a malignancy). However, the advent of effective antihypertensive drug therapy has improved the prognosis and patients with severe hypertensive retinopathy have similar outcomes to those with moderate hypertensive retinopathy [7]. Thus, acute treatment of such patients is the same whether or not papilledema is present.',\n",

       " 'Hypertensive encephalopathy  Hypertensive encephalopathy refers to the presence of signs and/or symptoms of cerebral edema caused by severe and/or sudden rises in BP. It is primarily a diagnosis of exclusion after other causes of central nervous system dysfunction are ruled out, and it characteristically responds dramatically to acute lowering of the mean arterial pressure, sometimes by as little as 10 to 15 percent.

       " 'MECHANISMS OF VASCULAR INJURYWith mild to moderate elevations in blood pressure (BP), the initial response is arterial and arteriolar vasoconstriction. This autoregulatory process both maintains tissue perfusion at a relatively constant level and prevents the increase in pressure from being transmitted to the smaller, more distal vessels [8].',\n",
       " 'With increasingly severe hypertension, however, autoregulation eventually fails  (figure 1) [8]. The ensuing rise in pressure in the arterioles and capillaries leads to acute damage to the vascular wall. Disruption of the vascular endothelium then allows plasma constituents (including fibrinoid material) to enter the vascular wall, thereby narrowing or obliterating the vascular lumen. Within the brain, the breakthrough vasodilation from failure of autoregulation leads to the development of cerebral edema and the clinical picture of hypertensive encephalopathy [8].',\n",
       " 'The level at which fibrinoid necrosis occurs depends upon the chronic baseline BP (prior to the substantial increase in BP). Patients with chronic hypertension have arteriolar hypertrophy that minimizes the transmission of pressure to the capillary circulation. Grades III and IV hypertensive retinopathy are often associated with diastolic pressures above 120 mmHg. By comparison, hypertensive encephalopathy can be seen at diastolic pressures as low as 100 mmHg in previously normotensive patients with acute hypertension due to preeclampsia or acute glomerulonephritis; patients in whom autoregulation is impaired also may develop hypertensive injury at relatively mild degrees of hypertension [8].',\n",
       " 'In addition to protecting tissues against the effects of severe hypertension, autoregulation also maintains tissue perfusion during the treatment of hypertension via arterial and arteriolar vasodilation. Since flow is equal to pressure divided by resistance, parallel reductions in both parameters allow sufficient blood flow to be maintained. However, an excessive hypotensive response below the autoregulatory range can lead to ischemic symptoms  (figure 1). The arteriolar hypertrophy induced by chronic hypertension means that hypoperfusion will occur at a higher BP than in normotensive subjects [8].',\n",
       " 'It has been suggested that factors other than the level of BP, particularly activation of the renin-angiotensin system, may contribute to the development of fibrinoid necrosis. Plasma renin activity is often increased in patients with grades III and IV hypertensive retinopathy, potentially mediated by both an initial natriuresis induced by the high pressure and renal vascular injury. The importance of the renin-angiotensin system in the vascular injury of severe hypertension has been demonstrated in transgenic rats [9]. In this study, rats prone to severe hypertension were treated with low-dose ramipril (5 mg/day) or no therapy. Ramipril significantly reduced the frequency of arteriolar fibrinoid necrosis, despite having no significant effect on BP, suggesting a role for the renin-angiotensin system independent of BP.',\n",
       " 'CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS AND DIAGNOSISModerate to severe hypertensive retinopathy and hypertensive encephalopathy most often occur in patients with longstanding, uncontrolled hypertension, many of whom have discontinued antihypertensive drug therapy [10]. Secondary hypertension, especially renovascular hypertension, is more common in patients with advanced hypertensive retinopathy than in hypertensive individuals without such funduscopic findings [11].',\n",
       " 'Clinical manifestationsIn addition to marked elevation in blood pressure (BP), the major clinical manifestations of hypertensive retinopathy and encephalopathy include the following [3,4,12,13]:',\n",
       " 'Patients with moderate to severe hypertensive retinopathy do not usually have visual symptoms, although 5 to 10 percent may have visual complaints. However, the ophthalmologic examination can reveal retinal hemorrhages and/or exudates (representing both ischemic damage and leakage of blood and plasma from affected vessels) and papilledema  (image 1). Yet few non-ophthalmologists can distinguish moderate from severe retinopathy, and the value of funduscopy in hypertensive patients is unclear [14]. (See  \"Ocular effects of hypertension\".)',\n",
       " '',\n",
       " \"Neurologic symptoms are frequent in patients with severe hypertension [15]. Hypertensive encephalopathy, which is related to cerebral edema, is characterized by the insidious onset of headache, nausea, and vomiting, followed by nonlocalizing neurologic symptoms such as restlessness, confusion, and, if the hypertension is not treated, seizures and coma [12]. In contrast, patients with ischemic stroke or intracerebral hemorrhage typically present with abrupt and focal neurologic symptoms. However, such patients may occasionally have insidious and generalized neurologic symptoms and, because the treatment of ischemic stroke and intracerebral hemorrhage differs significantly from the treatment of hypertensive encephalopathy, diagnostic brain imaging is critical to distinguish the cause of neurologic symptoms.

Thus, in the presence of neurologic symptoms such as headache, nausea, and vomiting, followed by nonlocalizing symptoms such as restlessness, confusion, seizures, or coma, a computerized tomography (CT) or MRI scan of the brain should be obtained to exclude an acute ischemic stroke or hemorrhage, which are not routinely (or primarily) treated by reducing BP [19].
